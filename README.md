Visual Chinese Analyzer
=======================

A user-friendly visual dependency parser for Chinese sentences  
It is based on the Stanford Parser and also includes a SQLite database to store all dependency trees  
  
- Offline version: In 'VisualChineseAnalyzer'
    - Usage: Import as an Eclipse project, execute the edu.pku.java.g3l.VisualChineseAnalyzer class  
    - This is one of my first Java programs I wrote many years ago, so I do not use packages to manage its source code. Package management is introduced in the online version of this program.
